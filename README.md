Greetings, I’m @BorisDivkovic,
A student at the IPI Academy in Tuzla, BiH.
I’m interested in programming and finding informal study groups to be a part of.
I’m currently learning - HTML, CSS & JavaScript.
I'll soon be jumping into the basics of full stack software development by learning individual components of the MERN system.
I'm adept in the following programming languages - C, C++ & C#.
